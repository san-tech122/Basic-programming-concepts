🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to the Python Projects folder!
This section contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Python projects created to reinforce core programming concepts such as:

✅ Variables and Data Types

✅ Conditional Statements and Loops

✅ Functions and Modular Code

✅ File I/O and Data Handling

✅ Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets


Each project is self-contained and aims to solve real-world problems using basic to advanced Python techniques. These are great for practice, building logic, and adding to your developer portfolio.
