# 🐍 Python Projects by Sanjay

Welcome to my collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects!  
This folder includes real-world programs built using core programming concepts such as:

- ✅ Variables and Data Types
- ✅ Functions and Loops
- ✅ Conditional Logic
- ✅ File Handling
- ✅ Dictionaries and User Input
- ✅ Project-based Problem Solving

Each file is a **self-contained project** demonstrating practical Python skills.
