# 🐍 Python Basics

This folder contains beginner-level Python programs covering **core programming concepts** such as variables, datatypes, conditions, loops, functions, and data structures. Each file is self-contained and includes comments to explain what each part does

## 🧠 How to Use

- Open any `.py` file and read the comments to understand the logic
- Try modifying values and running the code to test your understanding
- Practice by adding your own examples at the end of each file
